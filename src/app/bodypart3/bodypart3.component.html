					            	<h3><u>Own The Digital Asset Class</u></h3>
					              	<p>The cryptocurrencies that make up the DIME, also make up roughly 80% of the total cryptocurrency market cap.  Instead of trying to pick with Alt-Coins will be the "next Bitcoin," the DIME lets people invest in the asset class.  Passive Index Funds have outperformed over 95% of managed funds over the last 50 years.  Don't try to be a hero, by buying a DIME, you invest in the future of cryptocurrencies broadly, instead of speculating that one crypto will outperform another.</p>
													<p>Day trading is stressful, hard work, and often a zero sum game.  Holding a DIME is like owning a piece of the Internet in 1994.  You don't want to wake up in 2018 have bet on www.pets.com stock.</p>
