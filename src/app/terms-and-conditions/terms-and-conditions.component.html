              <ol class="lower-alpha">
                  <li class="lower-alpha">Generally.  In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Stack in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Stack agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND STACK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.                  </li>
                  <li class="lower-alpha">Exceptions.  Notwithstanding Section 8.a above, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>
                  <li class="lower-alpha">Arbitrator.  Any arbitration between you and Stack will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Stack.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
                  </li>
                  <li class="lower-alpha">Notice; Process.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or email (“Notice”).  Stack’s address for Notice is: Stack Financial, LLC, A Registered Agent, Inc., 8 The Green, STE A, Dover, DE 19901 or Legal@StackFinancial.io.  The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Stack may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Stack must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by Stack prior to selection of an arbitrator, then Stack will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Stack in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $10,000.
                  </li>
                  <li class="lower-alpha">Fees.  If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Stack will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.  In that case, you agree to reimburse Stack for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
