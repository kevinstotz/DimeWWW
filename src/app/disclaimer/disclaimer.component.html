                            accessible by the public and oral statements that may be made by the Fund Manager or
                            any of the Fund Manager Team on behalf of the Fund Manager, that are not statements

                            position, business strategies, plans and prospects and the future prospects of the

                            are not historic facts, but only predictions. These forward-looking statements involve

                            future results, performance or achievements of funds, cryptocurrencies, or the Fund
                            Manager to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements

                            cryptocurrency market conditions, and the regulatory environment in the countries in

                            that the Fund Manager may be unable or execute or implement their respective

                            competitive conditions under which the Fund Manager operate, and the ability of the
                            Fund Manager to compete under such conditions; (i) changes in the future capital needs
                            of the Fund Manager and the availability of financing and capital to fund such needs; (j)

                            any risk and uncertainties associated with the Fund Manager and its business and
                            operations, the DIMEs tokens, the DIMEs token sale and the underlying assets (each as
                            referred to in the White Paper). All forward-looking statements made by or attributable to
                            the Fund Manager and of the Fund Manager Team or other persons acting on behalf of
                            the Fund Manager are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors. Given that
                            risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual future results, performance or
                            achievements of the Fund Manager to be materially different from that expected,
                            expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this White Paper, undue

                            performance or achievements of the Fund Manager will be as discussed in those
                            forward-looking statements. The actual results, performance or achievements of Fund
                            Manager may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
                            statements. Nothing contained in this White Paper is or may be relied upon as a
                            promise, representation or undertaking as to the future performance or policies of the
                            Fund Manager. Further, the Fund Manager disclaims any responsibility to update any of
                            those forward-looking statements or publicly announce any revisions to those forwardlooking
                            statements to reflect future developments, events or circumstances, even if new
                            information becomes available or other events occur in the future.

                            PERSONS: This White Paper includes market and industry information and forecasts
                            that have been obtained from internal surveys, reports and studies, where appropriate,
                            as well as market research, publicly available information and industry publications.
                            Such surveys, reports, studies, market research, publicly available information and
                            publications generally state that the information that they contain has been obtained
                            from sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy
                            or completeness of such included information. Save for the Fund Manager and its
                            respective directors, executive officers and employees, no person has provided his or
                            her consent to the inclusion of his or her name and/or other information attributed or

                            and no representation, warranty or undertaking is or purported to be provided as to the
                            accuracy or completeness of such information by such person and such persons shall
                            not be obliged to provide any updates on the same. Neither the Fund Manager nor any
                            of the Fund Manager Team has conducted any independent review of the information
                            extracted from third party sources, verified the accuracy or completeness of such
                            information or ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein.
                            Consequently, neither Fund Manager nor its directors, executive officers and employees
                            acting on its behalf makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
                            completeness of such information and shall not be obliged to provide any updates on
                            the same.
